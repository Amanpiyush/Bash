## 📌 Why Bash?

Bash scripting is an essential skill for:

- 🛡️ Cybersecurity automation
- 📁 File system management
- 🧪 Scripting in Linux environments
- 🚀 Speeding up repetitive tasks
- 🔄 Building logic-based automation

Since I’m diving deep into **Cybersecurity**, mastering Bash is part of my foundation — both for web exploitation and for working as a SOC Analyst or Red Teamer.
